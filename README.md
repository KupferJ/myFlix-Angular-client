# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

Using Angular, the frontend for a movie-application was built, which pulls data from the <a href="https://github.com/KupferJ/movie_api" target="_blank">backend</a> to provide it to the users.

## Key Features
● The app displays a welcome view where users are able to either log in or register an account.  <br>
● Once authenticated, users have acces to a view presenting all movies.  <br>
● Upon clicking on a particular movie, users are taken to a single movie view, where 
additional movie details is displayed. The single movie view contains the following 
additional features:   <br>
     ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the ​ director view​, where details about the 
director of that particular movie will be displayed. <br>
     ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the ​ genre view​, where details about that 
particular genre of the movie will be displayed. <br>
● Users have the ability to add movies to their favorites and view, as well as edit them in a designated view. <br>
● Users can edit their personal information and delete their account. <br>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
